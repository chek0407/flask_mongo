**Flask API app**

## Description

This project consists of a Flask API backend and a static user interface (UI) hosted on AWS S3. The API provides [Brief description of what the API does, e.g., services for data processing, image uploads, user management], while the UI allows users to [Brief description of what the UI does, e.g., interact with the API, view data]. The API documentation is available via Swagger UI.

## Features

* Flask RESTful API backend
* Interactive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
* Static UI designed to be hosted on AWS S3
* [Add other specific features, e.g., File uploads to S3, Database interaction, User authentication]
* Designed for deployment using Docker

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python, Flask, [List any Flask extensions used, e.g., Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Cors]
* **API Docs:** Flask-Swagger-UI, OpenAPI Specification
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript [List any frontend frameworks or libraries used, e.g., React, Vue, jQuery, Bootstrap]
* **Deployment:** Docker, AWS EC2 (for API), AWS S3 (for UI)
* [Add any other relevant technologies, e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx]

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to have the following installed:

* Git
* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)
* Docker
* (Optional) AWS Account and AWS CLI configured, if deploying to AWS.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [Link to your GitHub Repository]
    cd [Your Project Folder Name]
    ```

2.  **Backend (API) Setup:**

    * Navigate to the API directory (if you have one, e.g., `cd api/`).
    * Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    * Activate the virtual environment:
        * On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
        * On Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    * Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        (Make sure you have generated a `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)

    * Build the Docker image:
        ```bash
        docker build -t [your-image-name] .
        ```

3.  **Frontend (UI) Setup:**

    * Navigate to the UI directory (if you have one, e.g., `cd ui/`).
    * [Add any specific UI build steps, e.g., `npm install`, `npm run build` if using Node.js for frontend tooling. If it's just static HTML/CSS/JS, you might just need to mention navigating to the directory.]

## Configuration

The application requires certain configuration settings, ideally managed via environment variables.

* `[Variable Name 1]`: Description of the variable.
* `[Variable Name 2]`: Description of the variable.
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS Access Key ID (**DO NOT HARDCODE**).
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS Secret Access Key (**DO NOT HARDCODE**).
* `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket.
* [List any other environment variables your API or UI uses]

You can set these environment variables in your terminal before running the application or configure them in your Docker setup.

## How to Run

1.  **Run the Backend API (using Docker):**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 [your-image-name]
    ```
    (Modify port mapping `-p 5000:5000` if your Flask app runs on a different port)
    The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Access the API Documentation (Swagger UI):**
    Open your web browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:5000/swagger
    ```
    (Modify the URL if your Swagger endpoint or port is different)

3.  **Run/Access the Frontend UI:**

    * **Locally:** You can often open the `ui/index.html` file directly in your browser for basic testing, but note that some features (like API calls due to CORS) might behave differently than when served from S3.
    * **Via S3:** Deploy the contents of the `ui/` folder to your configured AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting. Access the UI via the S3 bucket's public website endpoint URL.

## API Endpoints (Brief)

The API provides the following main endpoints:

* `[Endpoint 1]`: `[Method]` - [Description]
* `[Endpoint 2]`: `[Method]` - [Description]
* ...

Refer to the interactive Swagger UI (`/swagger`) for complete and up-to-date API documentation, including request/response schemas.

## Deployment

* The Flask API is designed to be containerized with Docker and can be deployed to platforms like AWS EC2, ECS, or EKS.
* The static UI files are intended to be deployed to an AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting, optionally fronted by Amazon CloudFront.
